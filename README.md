1. Launch the environment on AWS by using template for ECS (scalable).

2. My application is dockerized which required to pull an node image and for that you can use dockerfile in the repo.

3. After pulling the images create and container and launch it.

4. With help of ECS template we can route the traffie to the required port(mentioned is problem).

5. Now for CI JOB i'm using Circle CI for it (also we can use jenkins , For Jenkins file Please let me know if required).

6. Now after all the above steps, you're able to access your app.
